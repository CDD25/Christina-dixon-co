Christina Dixon Working Portfolio
I have almost no (pretty much no) idea what I am doing.  I am attempting to learn this though, using several resources all at once.  I's say I am making steady progress. :)

My goal is to create a visual portfolio of my work and learn the skills necessary to use git and github to save, modify and edit versions of my files.
My hope is get it totally and use git and github like I use any other application I am totally familiar with.  One day at a time!  Here goes nothing!
